    SLIDE TO DELETE
For the SLide to Delete Functionality,
I Made use of 'react-native-swipe-list-view' Package.

`npm install --save react-native-swipe-list-view`

Link to npm Docs for more Explanation: https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-swipe-list-view


    BOTTOM SHEET
For the Bottom sheet in the order screen, I made use of `reanimated-bottom-sheet` package


`npm install reanimated-bottom-sheet`

Note: AFter Installing this, you will also need to install react-native-gesture-handler and react-native-reanimated.

If you're using expo for your react native project
`expo install react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated`

If Not, you can just write
`npm install react-native-reanimated react-native-gesture-handler`
